Mukundhan Srinivasan is a Senior Solutions Architect - Machine Learning at NVIDIA Corp. He works alongside engineers and researchers from enterprises, R&D labs, startups and academia in designing and applying the science of machine learning at scale.

His focus is on making models performant and easy-to-use by data scientists on GPUs and in doing so drives the adoption of CUDA as a default computing platform for AI workloads. Mukund works along motivated enterprises to build platforms specifically for ML (for training and inferencing).

His present research interests include multimodal generations using GANs, CNN based querying for video tasks, Disentanglement & Deep Reinforcement learning and application of DL in healthcare. He has several published papers in machine learning domain and has over 50+ citations. He leads academic research collaborations for NVIDIA India.

Prior to NVIDIA, he was a co-founder of a startup that built developer tools for computer vision and NLU applications. Mukundhan began his career as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where he worked on Indic language OCR and TTS systems.

Outside of ML, he has a keen interest in studying the structure of societies, how economics are built and structured, and Indic classical music.
