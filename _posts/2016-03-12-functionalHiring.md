These notes are observed with [Khosla's hiring document](http://www.khoslaventures.com/the-art-science-and-labor-of-recruiting) as the baseline but for a more Indian context.

### Pre-Hiring:[Objective - Sell the opportunity to the candidate.]
- Complete background study about the candidate before first contact. Ask for references from at least one friend/well-wisher other that the regulars. 
- Manager/Reports must be confident about the potential candidate. (Possibly get an initial feedback from the team; helps set expectation.)
- Ask potential candidate their expectation about the hiring process. (Insight from experiences/past organizations.)

### Process: [Objective - Uncover inconsistencies and seek consistency. Attention towards Show vs. Tell. ]
- Check for culture fit. Will (s)he be a champion or a CEO of the product?
- Give them an opportunity to sell.
- What skills do they bring other than the functional requirements? Do they have the capability to ask difficult questions? 
- Will they contribute in removing the risk of failure?
- Technical functional Interview.

### Post Hiring: [Objective - Ensure smooth integration and take-off.]
- Integration check - Setting up the first task/challenge/job and following up with the outcome is mission critical. (Train existing employees to help with the integration.)
- Get feedback from the recent hire about the process.(Get feedback from even candidates we don’t end up hiring.)

### The interview

#### General Questions (Initial litmus test - 1) [Objective: Should we continue?]
- What are you optimistic about? 
- What is something that wouldn’t happen if you wouldn’t do it? 
- What does your manager/lead/boss think about your performance in your previous company? (Seek emotional distance and clarity of description.)
- What did your peers think about your contribution? (Look for a strong bond with ex-peers/friends. Shows team skills. Seek emotional distance and clarity of description.)
- What are your strengths and weaknesses? (Don’t expect the right answer. Their answer is non-consequential. Look for consistency with background check/references/self-descriptions/resumes etc.)
- What are the contributions that you’re particularly proud about? (Assess for consistency, any hint of team-work (I vs. We), and awareness about their contribution.)
- Do you believe, that your absence will make a difference in your previous job? (Look for Show vs. Tell and Evidence vs. Unsupported. Understanding this question requires some maturity.) Follow up: What do you think your previous company will not be able to do now that you have left? (Seek consistency in description.)
- What are some of the question you’d like us to ask your references? (Pay attention to what they wish to avoid.)
- Categorize their likes and dislikes from these answers. Look for preferences and biases. Does our company and its culture have a high similarity score. These interactions will broadly position the candidate as potentially hireable.  

#### Assessing Culture (Litmus test - 2) [Objective: ability to have fun + work with a team.]
- Describe a crisis. How would you respond to such a crisis? (Look for the approach and not the solution. All-hands-on-deck vs. singular outlook.)
- How long would you go before call it quits on a tough problem? (Look for capacity and resilience. Never say quit is a decent answer.)
- What in your opinion describes the “best” team? What is the best team you have been a part of? What made that team “best”? (This is a circle question. Pay attention to the answer given and quickly validate.)
- How would you handle a team member you aren’t comfortable with? (Caution: to be used against candidates for executive positions only.  Requires maturity to understand the question.)
- These interaction should reveal if the candidate complements our team, it’s skill and abilities.

#### Assessing ability to build teams and hire (Objective: Every manager must be a world-class recruiter.)(Applicable for leadership roles only.)
- What are some of the qualities of the best manager that you have ever worked with? Why do you feel these qualities are critical? (Level of thinking will be revealed along with their expectation for the role.)
- Who is the best technologist/developer they have worked with? (Ability to understand involved technical detail is revealed + their expectations about technologist/developer.)
- What would you look for in a new/potential hire? (Seek consistency with above and their attention to details. Are they able come with technical skill explicitly?)
- Have you had the opportunity to hire before? (Look for Show vs. Tell. Numbers/Stats?)
- If yes, who was the best hire? Why? (Pay attention to the reply. Do they describe any non-functional skills?)

- How much of new hiring do you believe you’ll have to do in our company? Why? (Check if the candidate has done some research about the organisation before showing up for the interview.)
- What are some of the question you’d ask potential new hires? 
- What type of recruiter is the candidate? We need aggressive recruiters. Depending on the HR or outsourcing the activity is a bad sign.Will they bring in the superstars they already know? Good network, good sign. Creativity and imagination are the ultimate skills a recruiter can have!

#### Assessing drive, critical thinking and mindfulness [Objective: Non-functional skills. What else?]
- What do you think about the company’s logo? Does it tell you a story/message? (Reveals the preparedness for the candidate? Is (s)he informed about the company?) By the way, what color is the logo now, and what color would you like to see it in?
- What do you like about the company? (Reveals how well we have sold the company to the candidate. Take feedback. Be wary of cliched answers like it’s a startup, etc. Monetary drive is not bad.)

- What do you look for in this business? (Test knowledge beyond implicit skills. Be wary about interview sake answers.)
- What are they ever proud of in each job they ever had? (Evaluate the depth and standard they set for (her)himself. Look for contributions beyond their JD. Make a note of roles they skip without explaining. Probe further.)
- If the candidate has switched areas, ask why? (Probe for about the thinking behind that decision.)

At this point, give the candidate the opportunity to ask questions about the company, role, team, culture etc?

- Does the candidate have a strategy to probe? (Look for any opinions formed. Suggestions about current business etc.)

Limit to high level questions here. Once the interview process is complete, give them another opportunity to ask absolutely any question.

- What are the other role you consider a fit for you? (Reveals self-value.)

- How do you take a decision? How long do you believe a decision should take? Why would a decision be delayed? (Probes further into the decision making ability.)
- Who would you go to if a decision has to be made? (Do they follow process or do what’s best for the company?)

- If you were given US$ 10MM asked to spend it without being held responsible, what would you do? Would you spend all the money or hold some off? Remember this doesn’t have to an investment! Could be just anything! (This is the scarcity vs. abundant thinking diagnostic. Look for a giving attitude.)

#### Assessing vision and imagination [Objective: Does the candidate challenge conventional wisdom? Is she a process follower?]
- How would you answer question to which you don not know the answers to? (Creative and maverick answers are appreciated. Blurting out is bad sign. “I will think about it and get back to you,” is a thoughtful answer.)
- What would be a game changer in your current role/business? (Ability to look beyond.)
- How well do you think on the fly about new areas/domains/jobs/tasks? (Assess the ability to pin down the right question to be asked. Blurting is a bad sign.)
