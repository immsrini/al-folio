title: Is deep learning becoming a Oligopoly market?

Clearly a few companies are running away with the majority share of the deep learning market. From where I see the DL market shaping today, its almost like the fuel retailing or Internet service providers or consumer banking markets. I believe we are headed towards Oligopolies as the concentration of data, algorithms and talent measure the proportion of total market share controlled by a given number of firms (likes of Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, ...). When there is a high concentration of the ability to adopt and develop a technology at scale with very few players, we identify those markets as oligopoly. 

> Oligopoly: a state of limited competition, in which a market is shared by a small number of producers or sellers.

Let's evaluate the characteristic of firms operating in a market with few close rivals include:

### Interdependence

A player who is interdependent may not be able to act independently. This is very true for companies building products/services based on Deep Learning. Mostly all firms have very similar data sources or similar strategy to porch talent from academia or playing catch with model complexities/depth and have to carefully consider when making a technical decision leave alone a business decision. 

A fair understanding the game theory concept of the prisoner's dilemma would help better visualize the current market dynamics. 

### Strategy

As the entire concentration ratio of the market is held together by few firms, everyone's strategy becomes interdependent. Anticipation qualifies as the most critical trait for all companies to respond on both price and non-price activity. If we have to draw a reference to the activity in the Deep Learning space, all companies are hitting it hard to win benchmarks with more elegant network architectures, highly fine-tuned optimization methods, special ways of sourcing training datapoints and custom/general chips for testing models. All of these firms distribute their plan to win benchmarks across hundreds of challenges in anticipation of others wins them. 

Double-clicking on strategies; Oligopolists have to take strategic decision like: 

- <strong>Compete vs. collude with rivals. </strong>

In case of Deep Learning, all major firms have taken to compete and compete fiercely in all verticals. If I had to pick one, let's look at acquiring talent. These firms attract and run behind good programmers with decent math and stats understanding. Large firms cherry pick tenured professors to lead research labs/teams from the best of institutions.


- <strong>Whether to raise or lower or keep constant with price.</strong>

The flavor of the season is keep most APIs freely available and open source all code as the data that is used to generate the results are available to everyone. My guess is it would be safe to assume things will remain free for a long time until the market structure changes and data isn't a barrier anymore.

- <strong>1<sup>st</sup> mover vs. 2<sup>nd</sup> mover advantage</strong>

We've seen Google's success with deep reinforcement learning in the form of AlphaGo, we'll wait see if someone can do better.

### Barriers to entry

Oligopolies and monopolies frequently maintain and thrive on the barriers the new entrants face. Today, the single greatest entry barrier for new startups or large organizations is the never-ending source of data. Deep Learning in tis current supervised black-box form needs TBs of data to significantly improve over multiple iterations. This barrier is now quite becoming a natural one the incumbent enjoy. 

As in Game Theory, only once we fully under the PD problem we appreciate the underlying dynamics of a game. Deep learning as a market is in my view that nascent stage that needs to be incubated to achieve returns technically.
