description: Notes to self from my past

For well over an year now, I've been organising the Deep Learning Bangalore (DLBLR) community which a node under a larger umbrella to drive AI technologies via communities in India. I believe, and it is public knowledge as well, that Indian as intrinsically good in logical and functional programming. We can with almost no inertia change languages all the way from prototyping to production. In a parallel universe, this must make us a great assets for the proliferation of  revolutionary technologies like machine learning and data science. With this bias, I founded the IndiaAI initiative which is an attempt to build an amazing community that serves as an open people platform attracting folks from academia, startups, Global R&Ds, GICs, ISVs, Service providers, investors, and practically anyone how is interested in AI and its derivatives.
 
The [IndiaAI initiative](https://indiaai.github.io/) consists majorly five node across India - [Bangalore (DLBLR)](), [Chennai (DLMAS)](), 
[Hyderabad (DLHYD)](), [Bombay (DLBOM)]() and [Delhi (DLDEL)]() to allow people to come together and discover and share knowledge and experiences in developing Deep Learning systems. The benefits of network effects are well studied and the know to supplement advancements in technology especially open sourced. All stable open sourced platforms/frameworks (Torch/TensorFlow/Python) are a testimonial to this fact of community driven progress. I wish IndiaAI builds this community  platform for our developer, researchers and enthusiasts. Organizing meetups has taught me many lessons, some for life, some on people, and a ton on Deep Learning. I shall list some of my learnings here:
 
1. <strong>Keep it free (mostly):</strong>
A community is generally a non-zero sum game in which people who attend and speak aggregate their gains. Unless you are absolutely sure of the value and attendee expectations to pay for a meetup; keep it free and open. Find ways to get cover cost by working with sponsors. 

2. <strong>Managing expectations is super critical:</strong>
This in my view is the single most critical factor in maintaining a healthy Net Promoter Value. For instance, if a startup wants a sales pitch of its offerings make that clear. If a R&D body is speak to hire, make that clear. There is always an audience to every format. Don't fear of loosing an audience and take down transparency. 

3. <strong>Have culture code:</strong>
Our culture code is [here](https://indiaai.github.io/about/). Defining the community's objectives helps in managing expectations while drawing the framework of operation. Having it written down is important. 

4. <strong>Vet technical content of speakers:</strong>
Once you have described the culture code, this becomes an extended necessity. Vet content. Let me tell you, the brightest of speakers can surprise you with the content. I've experienced this first hand.

5. <strong>Make a choice on the nature of people the community attracts:</strong>
This helps in solving the cold start problem. As organizers, we'll have to make a choice on the clusters of people the community attracts. You may be expecting CTO and CEO but it is important to understand which segment moves the needle.

6. <strong>Engage with sponsors:</strong>
Any activity will have some operational costs attached. Work along with relevant sponsors to find a balance of value exchange. This is also signal a serious community to potential members.

7. <strong>Take feedback regularly:</strong>
As a part of our culture, we usually take ask for feedback from attendees just before closing. We've got feedback on timings, content, formats and many more on which we have followed up and improved. Operating democratically usually pays.

8. <strong>Run it like your own startup:</strong>
If you are an organizer it your business to run the community. Don't hope it will remain in free fall once it is started. Every meetup announced requires the same amount of effort as the first one. 

When in doubt start from 1.
