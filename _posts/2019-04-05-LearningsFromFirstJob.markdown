description: Notes to self from my past

Recently I found myself resetting for new challenges and directions both professionally and personally. While I had this time, I recollected my most important learnings.

1. 10x 1 > 1x 10: We'd often hear, solve a problem 10x or deliver 10x results. This usually can be done in 2 ways; either solve a single problem with a focus on 10x outcomes or spread thinly across 10 problems. It is often hard to assess for self on with stream you are flowing while in the think of things. I've learned that spending quality time in posing the problem pays good dividends. You'll never regret not solving the other 9 problems if you focus well enough on one.

2. Strategy = sacrifice: This is a key learning from my time at NVIDIA. I was not only taught how to apply this filter but have seen seniors and other co-workers successfully using this judgment. Your strategy is what you choose not to do thereby driving critical importance to what you choose to do automatically. This classic filter can do applied to almost all stages of work; example: should we try this new package/product/service because everyone is talking about it? I'd usually ask myself the 10x 1 > 1x 10 question after this point. 

3. Read, read and read more: I personally love reading about POV descriptions from people who have been thru the grind, structures of society and first principles method of solving problems. Historically, I've never enjoyed reading but once I realized it the fastest way to learn, I quickly started picking up 1/2 books a month. I've found physical books more enjoyable than other digital formats. I'm in two minds if I should pay for Audible. 

4. Time is an investment: Saying NO to things tremendously improves your overall output. I never quite got the hang of this advice until I started to learn to think of time as an investment. Once you look thru that lens, best practices of investment will begin to apply. Attention is the currency. Bet wisely! Choose your sprint and marathons wisely! 

5. Skill up to sell: I can't say enough how critical selling is as a skill. No matter how niche/cool/advance your work is, it never speaks for itself. Selling internally is important for managers and selling to your customers is important for the overall entity. Once you polish your selling skills, you can recognize if you are being sold something. Many times I've found myself signing up voluntarily without knowing I've bought into a proposition. 

6. Always be coding. Neatly: Beyond programming itself, coding is a great way to express freedom, thought and logic. It is true that as you progress in your career you will take on non-coding responsibilities but never let others/seniors tell you middle manager needn't be hands-on. Never let go of the luxury to build using programs. If I can give you some evidence, take any sales team, approximately 40% of that team is filled with regret that they once knew to reason and code but not anymore. Once you think of your time as an investment, you'll, by extension need to be disciplined while coding. 

7. Give trust easily. At least once: It is very hard to build a strong work relationship without trust. You'll never feel safe if you don't trust the outcomes of your team members. So be the awesome one to extend trust first. During the early years of my career, trust was natural, but once I recognized patterns in behavior, I withdrew. In my shell, it was dark, unproductive and unhappy. As teams grow, mature and realign to new objectives you'll find yourself in conflict if you don't trust easily. I'd maybe try testing trust before blaming the culture. 

8. Happiness > Health > Wealth: Many wonderful people have written about these topics but I'm just coming out this realization. No amount of dollar compensation can bring your joy in the work you conduct unless you truly have a reason to believe that what you are doing is impactful. My biggest learning is that never let this priority change. You will have blobs in your mental timeline when this is distorted. Work towards happiness while being healthy and wealth usually follows with very minimal extra effort.  

9. Family first. Alway: I was lucky to have found my love about 10 months ago and we are now married. I've on all occasions found that the time invested in my family bring more happiness than all else. Never think too hard about professional vs personal tradeoffs unless you are the bottleneck in both. If you the sole person delaying the release then think twice, but you don't find yourself in that situation always. Visibly put your family first, always!

10. Managing expectation is your responsibility: I constantly find myself in paradoxical situations like, where co-workers attempt to communicate a very complex construct over Slack but never mentions the obvious. I've experienced that when I can articulate the necessary outcome as moving from point A to point B, I exactly been able to manage expectations. When there are unsaid/unstated expectations and those expectations evolve over time, you hit turbulence. My lesson is to clearly call out what I expect (even the really simple ones) from an exercise during the time of taking ownership.

11. Build standards for who you work with: Set this bar very high. I mean so high that you are the dumbest guy on your team. Again, I never regretted this instead had the opportunity to lift myself up to better levels. Someone rightly said, 'Don't work for bastards!' If you get an oppotunity to build a team, build it like you house. Have diverse skills and great/quick learners. 

12. Build a mentor/mentee network: Like energy, it a collosol waste to store knowledge as well. Learn, absorb, practice, distribute. What goes around come around. I was fortunate to find some really great mentors over time not only for work but people who'd take interest in my well being. I found this helping hand very timely. It was nudged me to extend one down myself.
