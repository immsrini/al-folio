<p>I’m back at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" target="\_blank">NVIDIA</a> in <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/" target="\_blank">TDot, Canada</a> for a second innings as a Senior Data Scientist focusing on ML at datacenter scale. Broadly, I’m interested in machine learning mechanisms and related system engineering. Research topics that I follow are generation applied to language, dialogue systems specifically generation &amp; evlauation, and lastly ideas on generalization. I’m often facinated by language.</p>

<!--- But this time at [TDot, Canada](https://www.toronto.ca/){:target="\_blank"}.-->

<p>I had a brief stint as Lead ML Architect at <a href="https://paytmlabs.com/" target="\_blank">Paytm Labs, Canada</a>. Prior that, I was a Senior Architect at NVIDIA in Bangalore where I had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers/engineers while building deep models, platforms, pipelines for training and inferencing workloads on GPUs.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I was a co-founder of <a href="http://marketlearning.io/" target="\_blank">Market Learning Labs</a> where we built developer tools for computer vision and NLP applications that ultimately failed due to non-functional GTM/sales. I was fortunate to start my career as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/" target="\_blank">Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</a> working on Indic language OCR and TTS systems.</p>

<p>I’m an active <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="\_blank">IEEE</a> volunteer contributing back to the scientific community for about a decade now. Presently, I serve as the Vice-Chair for the Membership Development Committee at the <a href="https://www.ieee.ca/en/" target="\_blank">IEEE Region 7 (Canada)</a>. Recently, I was promoted to a Senior IEEE Member and graduated from the <a href="https://mga.ieee.org/volunteer-development/volunteer-leadership-training-program" target="\_blank">VoLT program</a>. Reach out if you are interested in building communities! From time to time, I’ve advised select startups in the deeptech space.</p>

<p>Outside of CS/ML, I have a keen interest in studying the structure of economies, history of societies, and south-Indian classical music. I’m a student/practitioner of Sanatana dharma. I spend a disproportionate amount of time on horology and writing instruments.</p>

<p>I stopped following cricket after Rahul Dravid retired except for that occasional game. I’m a huge Federer fan - needless to say, no one has a better inside-out forehand. I continue to learn and play chess (mainly because it is another tab in the browser). I almost always play e4-e5.</p>

<p>I used to live in (beautiful) authentic part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore" target="\_blank">Bangalore</a> closer to CTR’s benne dose and Veena store’s idli chutney before moving to Toronto. Being from the south, I love my filter kaapi (yes, Kaapi!) and can be brided with a good one.</p>

<!---
I work as a Machine Learning Lead at [Paytm Labs, Canada.](https://www.paytm.ca/)

We build interesting engineering solutions to tackle scale challenges and deploy efficient models & pipelines. Our research/engineering directions are generally towards language understanding extending to Indic/low-resolution settings, dialogue systems, graph representations & networks, speech systems, recommendations, online advertising, auctions strategies, and select vision problems.

In a prior life, I enjoyed working at [NVIDIA Corporation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a Senior Solutions Architect for Machine Learning Systems where I had the opportunity to collaborate with organizations in building deep models, ML platforms, systems and pipelines for training and inferencing workloads on GPUs.

Before the awesome time at NVIDIA, I was a co-founder of [Market Learning Labs](http://marketlearning.io/) where we built developer tools for computer vision and NLU applications that ultimately failed due to non-functional GTM. I was very fortunate to start my career as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where we worked on Indic language OCR and TTS systems.

I’m an active [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) volunteer contributing back to the scientific community for about a decade now. Presently, I serve as the Chair, Membership Development Committee at the Toronto Section.

Outside of ML, I have a keen interest in studying the structure of societies, biographies, how economies are built/structured, and Indic classical music. I spend a disproportionate amount of time on horology, writing instruments, blades, and leathercraft.

I used to live in (still) beautiful and *original* part of Bangalore closer to CTR’s benne dose and Veena store’s idli chutney before moving to Toronto. Being from the south, I love my filter kapi (not coffee!) and can be brided with a good one.

Mukundhan Srinivasan is a Senior Solutions Architect - Machine Learning Systems at NVIDIA Corp. He works alongside engineers and researchers from enterprises, R&D labs, startups and academia in designing and applying the science of machine learning at scale.

His focus is on making models performant plus easy-to-use by data scientists on GPUs and in doing so drives the adoption of CUDA as a default accelerated computing platform for AI workloads. Mukund works along motivated enterprises to build platforms specifically for ML (for training and inferencing).

He leads some academic research collaborations for NVIDIA India. His present research interests include multimodal generations using GANs CNN based querying for video tasks, Disentanglement & Deep Reinforcement learning and application of DL in healthcare. He has several published papers in machine learning domain and has over 50+ citations. 

Prior to NVIDIA, he was a co-founder of a startup that built developer tools for computer vision and NLU applications. Mukundhan began his career as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where he worked on Indic language OCR and TTS systems.

Outside of ML, he has a keen interest in studying the structure of societies, how economics are built and structured, and Indic classical music. He lives in (still) beautiful old part of Bangalore closer to CTR's benne dose and Veena store's idli chutney.
